# Flat (VERY Early Development Stage!)

Flat is a 2D game engine originally created for coding practicing purposes. It neither tries to be the best nor the most innovative one. It simply wants to provide a initial base structure for 2D game development.

## Getting Started

Before installing the dependencies, make sure you have both [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

The project uses the task runner [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) ([`gulpfile.js`](gulpfile.js)) to generate the lib file, thus make sure you have the `gulp-cli` installed to run it.

To install all dependencies just run `npm install` where the `package.json` file is located.

To generate the `flat-engine.min.js` lib file, run `gulp` where the `gulpfile.js` file is located.

## Documentation

Still a TODO...

##Contribution

If you are willing to join me in this code practice and want to improve the engine, please, feel yourself being encouraged to do so.
